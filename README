This is a port of classic +acts_as_tree+ to Mongo Mapper.

It has (almost) the same functionality and passes the original test-suite. It (by principle) does not work for Embedded Documents.
TODO store path to parents/children as MongoMapper does not support eager-loading of associations.


acts_as_tree
============

Specify this +acts_as+ MongoMapper plugin if you want to model a tree structure by providing a parent association and a children
association. This requires that you have a foreign key, which by default is called +parent_id+.

  class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_tree :order => :name
  end

  Example:
  root
   \_ child1
        \_ subchild1
        \_ subchild2

  root      = Category.create(:name => "root")
  child1    = root.children.create(:name => "child1")
  subchild1 = child1.children.create(:name => "subchild1")

  root.parent   # => nil
  child1.parent # => root
  root.children # => [child1]
  root.children.first.children.first # => subchild1
